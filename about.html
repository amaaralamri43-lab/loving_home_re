    <h2>About Loving Homes</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Loving Homes was created with a simple mission: to provide a safe, comfortable, 
      and high-quality environment where dogs can feel happy, relaxed, and cared for 
      while their owners are away.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 15px;">
      We believe every dog deserves personalised care, whether they are staying for a 
      single day or enjoying an extended holiday with us. Our team works hard to create 
      a warm and friendly atmosphere where pets can enjoy playtime, relaxation, and 
      proper attention.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 15px;">
      At Loving Homes, safety, hygiene, and comfort come first. Our facilities are designed to 
      meet the needs of dogs of all breeds, ages, and temperaments. From climate-controlled 
      suites to outdoor play areas, we strive to make every stay a positive and enjoyable experience.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
      We are committed to giving pets a home away from home — a place where they can be 
      themselves, explore, socialise, and return to their owners happy and refreshed.
